Benesh
Hi! My name is Jennifer Benesh and I am a fourth year student at the University of Cincinnati. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and I am planning on going into Project/Manufacturing Engineering or design. I have recently worked at Rhinestahl as a Project Engineer Co-op and Valco Melton as a Manufacturing Engineer Co-op.

Valco Melton
Manufacturing Engineer Co-op 
During my experience at Valco Melton, I gained experience with routing, design, and organization. As a Manufacturing Engineer co-op, my duties were to work on improvement projects, design fixtures, update routers, and laser engrave parts. One of the larger projects that I worked on was the organization of the machine shop. During this project, I worked with a team of 4 people where we all used 5S practice. This project required us to organize all of the tools for every machine by type, material and size.

Rhinestahl
Project Engineer Co-op
For my third co-op experience, I switched positions within Rhinestahl from a Quality Engineer co-op to a Project Engineer co-op. Throughout this experience, I learned a lot of new skills within manufacturing, design and project engineering. Some of the projects I worked on during the semester included routing parts throughout the shop, quoting parts for customers, and designing multiple machine fixtures for parts. I worked on a couple of major projects during the semester.
